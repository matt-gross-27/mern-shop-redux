## Usage
Go to [Mern Shop Redux](https://mern-shop-redux.herokuapp.com/) and shop till you drop! The stripe integration uses a test api key so you won't actually be charged if you make a purchase.

## Tests
Navigate to the client directory and run the command ```npm test``` to test the reducer function passed into to the apps redux store. The tests check to make sure that both the initial state is unaltered and the selected action returns a new state as expected on dispatch.
